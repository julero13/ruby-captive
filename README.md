## ruby-captive

The intention is to build a simple captiveportal controller based on request's uri's.


##### Option 1
Create a clients scaffold. Where every client will have several captive-portal zones, serveral RADIUS custom configuration and so on.


#### Option 2
Single controller storing every clients URI, might be less flexible to add/modify clients settings?
